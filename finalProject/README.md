# *Final Integration Project Documentation*  
Create online documentation of your project. Think of this documentation as the place you would send someone if they asked you about the project. This should be the presentation of the project and its constituent parts, not an API, SDK, or entirely technical documentation of the work. 

## *Project Outline*
- Scope: The project integrates physical and digital interaction by combining an Arduino microcontroller with a P5.js graphical interface and Tone.js audio elements. It creates a responsive and interactive system that simulates weather patterns and NPC behavior. 
- Objectives: The Arduino must take in and process at least one digital or analog input and drive at least one digital or analog output.

  - The project must contain:
    - A graphical component with P5.js
    - An audio component with Tone.js
    - Interaction of Arduino, P5.js visuals, and Tone.js sound
- Key aspects: Users are able to interact with the webpage through selecting buttons with the cursor, pressing the physical button and photoresistor sensor.  

## *Narrative Description*
Become an omnipotent being, commanding the weather. Control the world with digital and physical interfaces, and observe the manner in which the roaming NPC reacts to wind, lightning, etc.

## *How It Works*
-  Click the *Lightning* button to watch light strikes occur and the NPC sprite run around in a panic
-  When selecting the *Wind*, clouds will move faster and the NPC sprite will be moving slower fighting back against the wind.
-  Mess with the light exposure on the photoresistor sensor to affect how light/dark the sky will be.
-  Selecting the pushbutton pin will activate the clouds so the clouds can be seen moving across the sky.

## *Future Development*
Although the core functionality was achieved, there were a few things I also wished to implement:  
-  Longer Weather Patterns: I desired to replicate more weather patterns by implementing additional sensors. These components were, however, broken and couldn't be used.  
-  Ambient Audio: Ambient audio would have added to the immersion of the experience, giving a soundscape even in instances where no specific weather events were being caused.
  
In the future, I plan to repair the damaged sensor components and make the NPC more environment-aware with smoother animations, weather effects, and layered audio.
