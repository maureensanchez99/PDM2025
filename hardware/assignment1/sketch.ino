Assignment 1 of Hardware Section  
You work for the haunted house company 17th Turnstile. In a new scary sci-fi exhibit they want you to detect a person's presence and trigger electrical items to flicker on and off sporadically. Do this with physical computing...  

You will need:   
- two digital inputs (i.e., two buttons)  
- two LEDs (or a buzzer or something else you can turn on/off)  
- code to make it blink in different patterns depending on which button is pressed  

For a challenge, have it say something in morse code.
