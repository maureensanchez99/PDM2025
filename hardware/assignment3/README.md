# Programming Hardware Assignment 3
Demonstrate Arduino and P5 communicating with one another. Write a P5 sketch that toggles a digital output connected to an Arduino on and off through keyboard or mouse interaction with a web page. For example a mouse click could turn the LED on and a second click could turn the LED off. 

Connect an analog input (photocell, potentiometer, etc) to the Arduino and use it to control something (perhaps the background color) of the same web page.
