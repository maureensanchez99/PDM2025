# Programming Hardware: Assignment 4  
Add Arduino interaction to either the Bug Squish or Painting App assignment. You MUST use the version with sound that you finished in the Audio section. You do not need to add any further sound or visuals to this project, only the ones you made from the Graphics and Audio units.   

For either choice move all user input from the mouse and keyboard to the Arduino. For instance, if you chose to modify the painting app you could use a potentiometer and tilt sensor to control the XY coordinates of the brush and a button to cycle through colors.   

Additionally, you should incorporate at least 1 output on the Arduino that is triggered by an event originating in p5.js. For instance, you could choose to have a buzzer play when a bug is squashed.  

## Submission Information  
Submit your .ino file and a zip file with your p5 project. Additionally, provide a link to a video showing your project working in the in the online text field.
