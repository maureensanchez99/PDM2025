# Assignment 2 of Audio section    
Create your own web synthesizer from the the built in synths/instruments in Tone.js or create your own! When a key is pressed, trigger a note. Be able to play at least 1 octave with an arrangement of keys that makes sense, or at least 8 distinct sounds. This can be using letter names for the keyboard reference or frequency numbers for a microtonal scale. Add an audio processor to make some variety of sound.  

Use any of the Tonejs Synths (Instruments) like PolySynth, PluckSynth or MetalSynth. Or create your own synthesizer by utilizing these elements:
- oscillator(s)  
- noise 
- filter(s)
- modulation and/or LFO 
- envelope(s)

Once you have your synth, create the keyboard mappings to trigger at least an octave of pitches, or at least 8 different sounds. Make sure to label your sketch so that its clear which keys are in use.   

Add a sound processor for sonic variety and a way to control the processor that feels intuitive. (Perhaps a slider, buttons, toggle, etc.) Make it sound good! This might require controlling of more than one parameter.  

No pre-generated audio files may be used.
