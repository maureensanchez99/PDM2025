# Assignment 3 of Audio section    
Find an image of an action or event that might occur. Then create a video game-like sound synthesis effect for this event. (Something like breaking a block with your head â€“ Super Mario style. Or diving into a pool.) When the canvas is clicked, display an image of the event and trigger your corresponding sound effect.  

Utilize a collection of these elements:  
- oscillator(s)
- noise(s)
- filter(s)
- modulation and/or LFOs
- envelope(s)
- instruments 
- effects

Make sure to do modulation of at least one parameter for the sound effect you are making. LFO, FM, AM synthesis, or an envelope or filter to change the quality of the sound. No pre-generated audio files may be used.
