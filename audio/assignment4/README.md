# 2.4 Final Sound Assigment   

## Bug Squish  
Make a fun musical theme with your new found sequence, scheduling and looping skills.  

Have in-game events trigger sonic events. These could be synthesized, soundfiles, or both. What is the sound of a squished bug? A missed bug? Frenzied bug skittering?  

As the game play changes, (increases speed, adds more bugs, nears the end) represent it sonically. How will the music or sound adapt?  

Incorporate game states into the sound design. e.g. start page, game over, etc. Adapt your music or interaction sounds accordingly.
