# Assignment 4 of Graphics section    
Write a P5 Sketch that implements a simple video game where you squish bugs (or other creatures) with the mouse.  

Begin with several bugs walking around the screen. The user must click the mouse on a bug to squish it. The user must squish as many bugs as possible in 30 seconds.  

Keep an on-screen count of the number of bugs squished and an on-screen timer counting down from 30 seconds. The game should get harder as it proceeds, so make the bugs move faster with each squish. After 30 seconds, the game ends.  

Animate the bug so that it faces the direction that it's moving. You can accomplish this by drawing an animation for each direction, or by simply using the rotate or scale function.  

It's recommended that you define a class to represent a bug, and use an array of objects to create several bugs.  

Note, the player must *click* on a bug to squish it. Do not simply test if the mouse button is pressed while the pointer is on the bug, as this lets the player click once and simply drag around to score squishes. Too easy!
